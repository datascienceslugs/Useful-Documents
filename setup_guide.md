# Software setup guide

*Anders Poirel*

Here's a list of the sofware the club uses. You should install these as soon as possible so that you can hit the ground running!


#### Slack

Most club communications will be through [Slack](https://slack.com/).


#### Github

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a user account.
Message Julan Lehrer or Anders Poirel on Slack so that you can be added as a collaborator on GitHub. This is will be necessary for 
pushing your contributions to team repositories and joining live coding sessions.

#### Git
    
To be able to use github you will also need version control installed on your local machine. Get the official installer 
[here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Be sure to select Git Bash at installation if you are on Windows. 
You can also use a GUI for Git but knowing command line will make things much easier for everyone down the line 
(and is a must in industry!). 
If you do not know any git, [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a great resource to get you started 
- reading the first two chapters will be enough for a working knowledge of Git.

#### Visual Studio Code

You can use your favorite text editor/IDE but to participate in live code collaboration you *will* need VS Code. 
Also, VSCode has really good support for data science tools in Python.
Get the official installer [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Launch VS Code and in **Extensions** (*Ctrl+Shift+X*) search 'VS Live Share' and install. 
I also highly recommend installing the 'Python' package from Microsoft.
Links to join  live collaborations will be sent out through Slack.

#### Anaconda

*Note: this is only necessary if you intend to run the code on your local machine. You can get started without it.*

Download the official installer [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). 
Be sure to select the **Python 3.7 version**. You will be able to install Python/R libraries as needed through Anaconda. 
The default installation should come with all the libraries you need to get started.
If you'd rather use command line only, install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). This is a minimal installation of Anaconda without GUI software.

#### Anaconda ALTERNATIVE if you do not want to install anything
Google Colab runs in the browser and comes with all the libraries you need to do basic data science in Python, so you can use this
to get started if you prefer.
